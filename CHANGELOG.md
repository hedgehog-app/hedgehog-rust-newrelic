## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Update [pin-project](https://crates.io/crates/pin-project) dependency to 1.0.0.
- Modify dependency versions to all be implicit caret requirements using full major.minor.patch specs. All dependencies
  other than `log` were already caret dependencies, so this is unlikely to affect anyone.

## [0.2.2] - 2020-03-02

### Added

- Support for distributed tracing behind the `distributed_tracing` feature flag. See the `distribued_trace` method
  of `Segment` for details (from [@bobbyrward](https://github.com/bobbyrward)).
- Support for async custom segments behind the `async` feature flag. See the `Segmented` trait for details (
  from [@bobbyrward](https://github.com/bobbyrward)).
- Ability to change transaction names using `Transaction::name` (from [@bobbyrward](https://github.com/bobbyrward)).
- An `App` can now be created fluidly using the `AppBuilder`. Many more settings can now be configured, including
  various recording thresholds, SQL recording obfuscation and event spans. See the new methods on the `AppBuilder`
  struct for details (from [@bobbyrward](https://github.com/bobbyrward)).

### Changed

- Upgrade to use `newrelic-sys` v0.2.0 (from [@bobbyrward](https://github.com/bobbyrward)).
- `ExternalParams` and `DatastoreParams` are now `Send` / `Sync` to enable use in async segments.
